# OpenInsight
OpenInsights is an open-source, web-based dashboard solution developed as an alternative to proprietary BI tools like Power BI and Tableau. It integrates with the Power BI REST API to fetch JSON-formatted datasets (e.g., sales, KPIs, customer metrics) and renders interactive visualizations using React, Chart.js, and Apache ECharts.
